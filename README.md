# About The Project
This project builds a compiler for an Object Oriented language defined by the MIT specification of COOL. Each branch implements the
frontend, backend and semantic sections of the compiler whilst main is the combination of all three, creating a full compiler.
This compiler takes in COOL syntax code, and returns valid MIPS assembly code that represents the COOL program.

### Required Tools
- ANTLR (Another Tool For Language Recongnition) version 4.12 or greater
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 16 or greater
- MIPS assembler

The file extension for this language is .cl i.e foo.cl
